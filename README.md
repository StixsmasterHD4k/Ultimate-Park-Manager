Ultimate Park Manager is an all-in-one automation plugin for OpenRCT2 that takes the tedious micromanagement out of running a successful theme park. It automatically calculates and sets optimal prices for rides, park admission, and shops based on proven algorithms from the RollerCoaster Tycoon community.

Never again will you need to manually adjust ride prices as they age, fiddle with shop prices when the weather changes, or guess at the right park entry fee. This plugin handles it all while giving you full control over how aggressive or conservative the pricing should be.
